# üçΩÔ∏è Recipe App (SwiftUI + Async/Await + MVVM)

## üì∏ Summary

This SwiftUI app displays a list of recipes fetched from a remote API. It supports:

- Pull-to-refresh for reloading recipes
- Graceful handling of empty and malformed data responses
- Custom disk image caching (no URLCache or third-party libs)
- MVVM architecture with `async/await`
- Unit testing for core logic (`RecipeService`, ViewModel)

## üéØ Focus Areas

I prioritized:

- ‚úÖ **Async/Await Networking**: All API calls are built using structured concurrency.
- ‚úÖ **Disk Image Caching**: Images are cached manually to disk to minimize bandwidth, not relying on `URLCache`.
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: The app discards all recipes if the JSON is malformed and gracefully shows an error.
- ‚úÖ **MVVM Architecture**: Separates UI, business logic, and networking for testability and clarity.
- ‚úÖ **Testability**: Focused unit tests on `RecipeService`, ViewModel behavior

## ‚è± Time Spent

**Total: ~5-6 hours**

| Task | Time Allocation |
|------|-----------------|
| Core features (UI, networking, state mgmt) | ~2 hrs |
| Custom image caching logic | ~2 hrs |
| Error handling + malformed/empty data scenarios | ~1.5 hrs |
| Unit testing (service + caching + ViewModel) | ~1 hrs |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs and Decisions

- ‚ùå Did not implement pagination or search to keep the scope aligned with core requirements.
- ‚úÖ Used `@StateObject` and `.task` with flags to avoid repeated API calls on re-render.

---

## ‚ùóÔ∏èWeakest Part of the Project

- The **custom image caching** implementation is functional but basic. It could be improved further with:
  - LRU cache strategy
  - Better directory management
- UI is minimal ‚Äî no animations or advanced layout enhancements due to time scope.

---

## üîç Additional Information

- **SwiftUI Lifecycle**: Used `.task` with a local flag (`hasLoaded`) to avoid multiple API calls during view re-renders.
- **Test Endpoints**:
  - Malformed: gracefully discards and shows error
  - Empty: shows a user-friendly message
- **No External Libraries** were used, per the assignment guideline.
- **Platform**: macOS 14+, iOS 17+
